IPN Overview :
------------

* PayPal Instant Payment Notification is call back system that initiated once a tranction is completed  
  (eg: When a Pay API completed successfully).
* You will receive the transaction related IPN variables on your call back url that you have specified in your request.
* You have to send this IPN variable back to PayPal system for verification, Upon verification PayPal will send  
  a response string "VERIFIED" or "INVALID".
* PayPal will continuously resend this IPN, if a wrong IPN is sent.

IPN How to use
--------------
* Include 'ipn/PPIPNMessage.php' in your IPN callback URL  
* Initialize IPNMessage constructor with a map containing configuration parameters, as shown below.

		// Array containing configuration parameters. (not required if config file is used)
		$config = array(
		    // values: 'sandbox' for testing
			//		   'live' for production
			"mode" => "sandbox"
			
			// These values are defaulted in SDK. If you want to override default values, uncomment it and add your value.
			// "http.ConnectionTimeOut" => "5000",
			// "http.Retry" => "2",
			);
		$ipnMessage = new PPIPNMessage(null, $config);   
* 'validate()' method validates the IPN message and returns true if 'VERIFIED' or returns false if 'INVALID'  
Ex:
		$result = $ipnMessage->validate();
		  
  Initiating IPN:
* Make a PayPal API call (eg: Pay ), setting the IpnNotificationUrl field of API request   
  to the url of deployed IPNLIstener sample(eg:https://example.com/adaptivepayments-sdk-php/IPN/IPNListener.php)  
  the IpnNotificationUrl field is in 'PayRequestDetailsType' class under API request class  
 (Ex: 'PayRequestDetailsType->IpnNotificationUrl')  
* You will receive IPN call back from PayPal , which will be logged in to log file in case of IPN sample.
* See the included sample for more details.
* To access the IPN received use 'getRawData()' which give an array of received IPN variables  
Ex:
		
		$ipnMessage->getRawData();
